The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be cases where the calculation results in an invalid value, leading to unexpected behavior. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` in a situation where the parent element's width is too small to accommodate that calculation can lead to negative values, resulting in the element collapsing or displaying improperly.

Another issue can arise when dealing with units. Ensuring that you're using consistent units in your calculations is crucial; mixing units might produce unexpected results and errors. For instance, `calc(100px + 2em)` will work but needs careful consideration of the `em` unit's context-dependent nature.
