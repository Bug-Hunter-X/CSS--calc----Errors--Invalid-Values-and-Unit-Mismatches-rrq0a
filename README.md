# CSS `calc()` Errors and Solutions

This repository demonstrates two potential issues that can arise when using the CSS `calc()` function: 

1. **Unexpected Values:**  Calculations that result in negative or invalid values can lead to unexpected rendering behavior. 
2. **Unit Inconsistencies:** Using inconsistent units within the calculation can cause errors.

The `bug.css` file contains code showcasing these problems. The solution, found in `bugSolution.css`, shows how to mitigate these issues through careful calculation design and unit consistency.
